# Manual-Canny-Edge-Detection

Required library to run:
1. OpenCV version 3.4.2
2. Matplotlib
3. Numpy

## Explanation
The Canny edge detector is an **edge detection operator** that uses a multi-stage algorithm to 
detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Canny also produced a computational theory of edge detection explaining why the technique works. (Wikipedia)

The Canny edge detection algorithm is composed of 5 steps:
1. Noise reduction;
2. Gradient calculation;
3. Non-maximum suppression;
4. Double threshold;
5. Edge Tracking by Hysteresis.
